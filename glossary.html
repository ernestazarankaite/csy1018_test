    <div class="row">  
    <div class="col">

    </div>
    
    <div class="col">  
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>The body is the container for all of a page's content. Comes after the HEAD tag, within the overall HTML tag.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col"> 
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>HTML comments are sometimes used in code to explain parts of the markup. They are similar to comments in other languages. Users do not see comments in their browser.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
      
    <div class="row">  
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Div</h3>

    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>Heading elements like h1, h2, h3, ... allow you to use six levels of document headings, ranging from largest to smallest, breaking up the document into logical sections. </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="row">  
    <div class="col">

    </div>
    
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
    <p>Hyperlinks (or just links) take the user to another webpage when they click on it. The most common attribute used with links is href, which tells the browser where the link goes.</p> 
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>The img tag embeds an image into your HTML. Always found with the 'src' attribute, which tells the browser where to find the image.      Note that the img tag is self-closing.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="row">  
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>Link elements are used to connect your document to a related resource (very different from hyperlinks, which take you to another webpage when you click on them). Links appear only in the head section of a document so they do not alter the content, but only the presentation. Links are most commonly used to connect to a stylesheet, script, favicon, or alternate format of the page such as an RSS feed or PDF.</p>
    </div>  
    
    <div class="col">
    <h3>List</h3>
    <p>HTML supports two kinds of lists: ordered lists and unordered lists. Within lists each individual list item has its own tag.
    Unordered lists are just lists whose items are denoted with bullet points. Ordered lists items are denoted with numbers.  </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col">

    <div class="row">  
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Tables</h3>

    <div class="col">
    <h3>Padding</h3>
    <p>An element for displaying information in rows and columns. Supports headers and footers for labeling columns. Divides information into rows (denoted by the tr tag) which contain cells (denoted by the td tag).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Margin</h3>
    <p>The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other. Here, the div with id 'box' will get 10px of margin above and below it, and 5px of margin to the left and right.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    
    <div class="col">
    <h3>ID Selectors</h3>
    <p>ID selectors are used to select only a single item on a page. Like the term ("identification") indicates, ID selectors will ONLY select the first element with a matching ID.</p>

    </div>
    
    
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Universal selectors</h3>
    <p>The universal selector (*) may be used to select all the elements in a particular range. Be aware that the universal selector is the most performance taxing selector, and should be used sparingly.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
    <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid results — often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="col">
    <h3>jQuery</h3>
    <p>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web. jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License.</p>
    </div>
      
      
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Web Developer Tools</h3>
    
    <p>Web development tools allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and IDEs in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user facing interface of a website or web application.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
      
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Code Editing Tools</h3>
    <p>A source code editor is a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code of computer programs by programmers. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (IDE) or web browser. Source code editors are the most fundamental programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code.</p>
