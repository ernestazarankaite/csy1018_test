                <p>Since starting my journey with web design,
                   I have faced many different challenges. 
                   Challenges that can be hard, but found that 
                   if you apply yourself and work through them, 
                   as the pieces all come together there is a huge 
                   amount of self-achievement.  This term opened my 
                   eyes to what it is required to be a web developer, 
                   especially since I started from zero. I didn’t really 
                   know what exactly coding HTML or CSS was back then, but
                    I knew everyone was talking about it, and that if I wanted
                     to become a web developer I needed to learn it. </p>
              </div>
               <div class="col">
                <p> After a couple months into the course I understood 
                  that developing is a subject where you will never stop 
                  learning and being on the lookout for new things all the
                   time, as this will allow you to become the best developer
                    who always stays ahead of the curve. Learning to code felt
                     much more relaxed with the help of my team, they were 
                     understanding during my first project and helped me overcome 
                     all issues. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                
                  
                <p>They constantly motivated me to try new things. 
                  I also found weekly tutorials and ‘slack’ app extremely 
                  beneficial when I got difficulties with coding this project.
                   During this time, I have experienced both fun and frustrations
                    and have enjoyed it all, it has left me excited to start my second
                     semester, to learn Java and much more.  I will present a couple 
                     screenshots below to show my improvement over the past nine weeks.
