          <p> My name is Ernesta Zarankaite.
            My goal in life is to always love what I am doing. 
            This includes my work and my free time. I am currently a Business Computing System student on 
            University of Northampton and I am immersing myself in all that this new city has to offer, 
            also discovering living and learning as a young adult and where I want my professional career to take me. <p/>

          <p> My name is Tinuke Olukoya, 
            I am a Business Computing student at the of Northampton University.
             I started my academic career back in the day studying Hospitality management in Dublin.
              However, I had to take a break when nature called for me to become a mother of two boys.
               I was later encouraged by some of my friend to develop myself in computing by going back
                to the University to get a degree in Business Computing due to my commitment and passion.   <p/>

          <p> My name is Aisha Yusuf. I live in Northampton. I am a mature studen. At the moment I am studying computing
            and I enjoy it. In Sep 2016 to June 2017 I studied at Northampton College and Iâ€™ve achieved
            BTEC level 3 Diploma in system support. This course was gave me more confidence in
            understanding the computer system. <p/>
